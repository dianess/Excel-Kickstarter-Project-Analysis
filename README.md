# Kickstarter-Project Analysis
In this project, I analyzed Kickstarter data from the years 2009 to 2017 in an Excel file to find which projects were successful compared to those that failed or were canceled. The .doc file contains the analysis. The .xlsx file contains the data with conditional formatting and charts.
